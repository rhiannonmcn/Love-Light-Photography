# Objective

In this project I aim to deliver a professionaly developed website for users to access a friendly but professional photography service. The main objective is to exhibit a proficiency in HTML AND CSS.

# User Experience (UX)

## Design Prototype

The design for this website were compiled in Adobe XD. The designs produced were low wireframes and a high fidelity wireframe for the homepage for desktop versions only.

## Site Structure

Love Light Photography consists of 5 page website with 4 pages that the user can navigate between via the navigation bar.  The Home page is the default loading page. The Logo is centered and is also linked to the Home Page. On the left hand site of the logo are two navigation links of [Home](index.html) and [Packages](packages.html). And on the right side of the logo are another two navigation links of [Gallery](gallery.html) and [Contact](contact.html).

## Design Choices

* ### Colour Scheme
    The final colour schem chosen was a dark teal with an off white text, as well as off white and light grey to segment pages. Two lighter teal colours were used on the navigation bar to highlight the active page and for the hover effect. This colour scheme is very on trend with the clean and modern look but still has that hint of warmth by sticking to the warmer tones of teal, greys and whites.

* ### Typography
    There were two types of fonts chosen for this website. 'EB Garamond' was used for the body text and 'Cormorant Garamond' for the headings, which is only a slightly different version Garamond than the body text to provide emphasis. Both fonts fall back to 'sans-serif'. The Garamond fonts have a slightly luxurious feel to them and the serif detail, provides a small bit of complexity to the design but with making use of letter spacing and line heights to still keep it in line with the clean look.
