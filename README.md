## Design Wireframes

The design and structure for this website was created in Adobe XD. The designs produced were low fidelity wireframes for desktop versions only. The final designs and structure differ from the wireframes due to developments during the construction of the website.

<details><summary> Low Fidelity Wireframes </summary>

</details>

## Site Structure

Love Light Photography consists of 5 page website with 4 pages that the user can navigate between via the navigation bar.  The Home page is the default loading page. The Logo is centered and is also linked to the Home Page. On the left hand site of the logo are two navigation links of [Home](index.html) and [Packages](packages.html). And on the right side of the logo are another two navigation links of [Gallery](gallery.html) and [Contact](contact.html).

## Design Choices

### Colour Scheme

The final colour scheme chosen was a dark teal with an off white text, as well as an off white and light grey to segment pages. Two lighter teal colours were used on the navigation bar to highlight the active page and for the hover effect. This colour scheme is very on trend with the clean and modern look but still has that hint of warmth by sticking to the warmer tones of teal, greys and whites.

![Colour palette image of 6 colours](assets/images/readme-images/colour-palette.png)

### Typography

There were two types of fonts chosen for this website. 'EB Garamond' was used for the body of the text and 'Cormorant Garamond' for the headings, which is a slightly different version Garamond than the body text to provide emphasis. Both fonts fall back to 'sans-serif'. The Garamond fonts have a slightly luxurious feel to them and the serif detail, provides a small bit of complexity to the design but with making use of letter spacing and line heights to still keep it in line with the clean look.

# Features

Love Light Phtography is designed and structured like a typical website, making it very natural and intuitive to use to entice the user to explore further.

Each page, except the Home Page, has a clear heading when landing on the page and short paragraph introducing the content. The language, colour and design used is intended to be friendly and easy to understand.

## Navigation

* The navigation menu is featured at the top of the page and contains the links to main content.

* The logo is centered in the navigation bar and is clickable and links back to the homepage.

* There are three variations of the navigation bar for different screen sizes, and each keep the same colour and design styles with only the structure changing to keep the user experience as smooth as possible.

![Desktop Navbar](assets/images/readme-images/navbar-desktop.png)

![Medium Screen Navbar](assets/images/readme-images/navbar-medium-screen.png)

![Mobile Navbar](assets/images/readme-images/navbar-mobile.png)

## Home Page

 * The Home Page is the landing page of the website and the first part that the user will see. It is designed to be welcoming and the purpose of the website easily determined.

 * There is a large hero image chosen for its' style, colour scheme and tone to match the website itself and it's immediately visible. Overlayed on the hero image is site name and a catchy slogan.

 * There is a bit of content peeking just above the fold to show users that there is more information on the page. This is a quote and it's designed to give off a particular feel of the website to the user; essentially the ethos of by which the business stands by.

 * There is a section "Meet the Photographer" which is a succint About Me section intended to put the user at ease, keep the welcoming vibe whilst still imparting useful information and engaging with the user.

 * The last seection on the Home Page is a Stories section, which provides three different testimonials.

 * The aim of each of these sections of the Home Page is to create a feeling of welcoming and friendliness and to encourage the user to explore the website in the hopes of hitting that Contact Page.

 * Each section is fully responsive, with the multiple column content naturally falling into single column content.

 ![Desktop Homepage](assets/images/readme-images/home-page.png)

 <details><summary>Mobile Home Page</summary>

 ![Mobile Homepage](assets/images/readme-images/home-page-mobile.png)

 </details>

## Packages Page

* The packages page is as described in its navigation link. It lists the available services in a clear manner.

* There is a list of the available packages, using clear alternate colour design elements to distinguish the different packages, as well as headings, images and text.

* It is fully responsive and each package section contents naturally fall into a single column, with the same clear colour design elements to distinguish each package.

* This page is intended to impart the idea that this service is welcoming, friendly and the perfect fit for what the user is looking for but that the business can be approached for more information related to their particular event/occasion.

![Desktop Packages Page](assets/images/readme-images/packages-page.png)

## Gallery Page

* The Gallery page provides the user with some sample photography from the photographer. It gives a mix of different events and occasions in one large gallery.

* The gallery is easy to use, with a hover function on the images drawing the users eye to the cursor.

* The Gallery page is fully responsive and as the screen reduces in size the columns of images reduce until the images are full width in mobile devices.

![Desktop Gallery Page](assets/images/readme-images/gallery-page.png)

<details><summary>Mobile Gallery Page</summary>

![Mobile Gallery Page](assets/images/readme-images/gallery-page-mobile.png)

</details>

## Contact Page

* The Contact page is should be where the user ends up. As there is no booking system or online store to purchase a package the aim is for them to reach out to the business.

*  The contact form is modelled off the usual contact form layout, with four input fields; First Name, Last Name, Email Address and Your Message.

* The contact form cannot be submitted unless the fields are filled correctly using the required attribute.

* The form also uses a GET function to link to a Thank You page to mimic the effect of actually submitting the form . There is no actual information submitted when the user completes the form and the thank you page is purely to show how the user will interact with the form.

* Beside the contact form there are practical contact details such as a dummy phone number and email. The email has a mailto link which opens to the users default mail software on their device, againing using a dummy email for the purpose of user experience.

* There is also a google map iframe beneath the Location section.

* The page is fully responsive with the sections stacking upon each other as the screen size is reduced, keeping the same design elements which distinguish between the different sections.

![Desktop Contact Page](assets/images/readme-images/contact-page.png)

<details><summary>Mobile Contact Page</summary>

![Mobile Contact Page](assets/images/readme-images/contact-page-mobile.png)

</details>

## Thank You Page

* The Thank You page cannot be accessed by the user from any links on the website. It can only be accessed by submitting the contact form on the Contact page which uses a GET function to retrieve the page to imitate the contact form submission.

* The style and design of the website is consistent, with the navigation bar on top and footer on the bottom so as to allow the user to navigate back to the main website.

![Desktop Thank You Page](assets/images/readme-images/thank-you-page.png)

![Mobile Thank You Page](assets/images/readme-images/thank-you-page-mobile.png)

## Footer

* The Footer contains the social media links.

* For better UX design, each of the social media links open in a new tab.

* The Facebook, Instagram and Youtube links are purely for the educational purposes of the website and only navigate to the home page of each of the sites.

* It also contains an email link which uses a mailto function to open the devices preferred email software. The email used is just a dummy email to show how the user interacts with the link.

![Desktop Footer](assets/images/readme-images/footer.png)

![Mobile Footer](assets/images/readme-images/footer-mobile.png)

# Future Features

* The Stories section on the Home Page could be made a bit more interactive with more stories that could be rotated through with only 3 stories showing at a time on the homepage.

* The gallery can be expanded whereby a lightbox function can be implemented to achieve a greate user experience and interactivity with the images.

* The gallery could also be categorised by event/occasion for better UX, to allow the user to navigate directly to photos of interest to them.

* A Log In could be added whereby clients would have access to the photos of their event in a private gallery, will will provide a swifter service for the business, cutting out another physical meeting with clients to choose their photos.

* The mobile navigation menu could be changed into a burger menu.

* An eccomerce online shop could be added for the sale of stock prints.

## Bugs Fixed

### HTML Validation
    
The following error was presented once the website was placed through W3C HTML Validator.

![HTML Validation Error 2](assets/images/readme-images/html-validator-error-2.png)

It said that the width and height attributes in the footer images produced " Expected a digit but saw p instead". Once I removed the px from the width and height attributes, it cleared that error up.

### CSS Validation

The following error cropped up when the site was initially put through CSS validation.

![CSS Validation error](assets/images/readme-images/css-validator-issue.png)

While no problems were indicated in the CSS file in GitPod, it did show up in validation. To fix this error, in the font-family declaration, I changed all the double quote around the font family to single quotes and the error cleared.

### Lighthouse Testing

The first error that cropped up with lighthouse testing with regards Best Practices and thus affecting also the Performance section. This error was across all pages and had to do with external links and security.

![Lighthouse initial testing](assets/images/readme-images/rel-noopener-fix.png)

It was recommended to add the rel=noopener to any external links, which cleared the error.

As well as this, the initial scores were fluctuating between the low greens to the orange on a few of the pages. Upon further inspection, these were on the pages which held a large quantity of images, mainly the Gallery Page and Packages Page. Both these results were in the mobile and desktop testing.

![Lighthouse Testing Image 1](assets/images/readme-images/desktop-lighthouse-test-gallery-2.png)

![Lighthouse Testing Image 2](assets/images/readme-images/desktop-lighthouse-test-gallery-3.png)

The errors shown were:
1. Serve images in next-gen formats
2. Properly sized images
3. Serve static assets with an efficient cache policy
4. Image elements do not have specific width and height

* Problem 1 -Serve images in next-gen formats
    * Serving images in next-gen file formats like webp would improve the score however upon research, it was best to leave my images as JPEG files, as this is the best file format for colour, depth and clarity of photos which is extremely important for a photography business website. The images however were exported as progressive JPEG files to allow the browser to load a simple version of the image before loading the full resolution photo. A lot of next-gen file formats are also currently not supported by a lot of browsers.

* Problem 2 - Properly sized images
    * This problem was initially addressed by running the photos through lightroom and exporting them for screen and compressing them using [Tiny.png](https://tinypng.com/). This was still not enough, however so they were brought into photoshop and were cropped to exact sizes, exported as progressive JPEG files and compressed again via tiny.png. This cleared the warning.

* Problem 3 - Serve static assets with an efficient cache policy
    * Caching is a problem that could not be solved as it's the host's issue, in this case Github pages controls the problem.

* Problem 4 - Image elements do not have specific width and height
    * This was fixed by adding width and height attributes to image tags and thus the warning was cleared.

### SVG Logo File

 A logo for the site was created using Adobe Illustrator and it was exported as a SVG file, done so for the repsonsive ability of the svg file and the sharpness and quality of the image itself.

 However there were issues with it showing up with a size of 0px in browsers.

 The fix was found here : (https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/issues/552) and it corrected when an actual height and width was set to the img tag.

 While this fixed the issue in Chrome and Mircrosoft Edge, it did not in Firefox.
 
 ![Firefox SVG logo issue](assets/images/readme-images/firefox-issue-2.png)
 
 Upon further study the width and height that was set to 100% had no point of reference and thus setting the height and width attribute in the html fixed the problem in firefox as the percentage widths in the CSS then had a point of reference.

### Responsiveness

Chrome Devtools was initially used to test the responsiveness of the website. However it proved to be somewhat inconsistent with results despite no code being changed. Therefore another Chrome extension was used, [Viewport Resizer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/viewport-resizer-%E2%80%93-respon/kapnjjcfcncngkadhpmijlkblpibdcgm?hl=en) and a website, [Responsive Design Checker](https://responsivedesignchecker.com/) was used in conjunction with Chrome Devtools to make sure the website was fully responsive.

![Chrome Devtools responsive viewer](assets/images/readme-images/responsive-issue-2.png)

![Viewport Resizer Chrome Extension](assets/images/readme-images/responsiveness-issue.png)

![Responsive Design Checker](assets/images/readme-images/responsive-issue-3.png)

There were overflow issues that couldnt be determined easily once certain screen sizes were reached, particularly the mobile screen size. To help identify the overflow issues, the problem was googled and answer found in [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31458477/find-element-that-is-causing-the-showing-of-horizontal-scrollbar-in-google-chrom) and a piece of code was used to outline all the elements on a page, allowing the elements that didnt line up to be identified.
